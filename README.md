# COUNTING MONOMIAL CREMONA MAPS

The Cremona.sws file should be used in the SageMath software, which can be downloaded at http://www.sagemath.org/

The Cremona.sagews file should be used at https://cocalc.com

To run the program in cases where they have many generators it is recommended to use SageMath on a powerful computer.

To run the case N = 7 and D = 3 we use a computer with a 3.4 Ghz I7 processor and 24Gb ram and took about 10 days.

The Cremonas(7.3).txt file has all the Generators of the Cemoras with N = 7 and D = 3, generated by the routine available in the file Cremona.sws
